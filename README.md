# Cam-ForestNet
Model to classify direct deforestation drivers in Cameroon.

Folder
------
- 'model': This folder contains the classification model and most of the code was written by [Irvin et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05479.pdf). Our changes are all identified with *#AD* in the code. These changes were made to adapt the model for our case study/different types of input data/different tests for improvements including data fusion and time series analysis.

- 'prepare_files': This folder contains all of the steps needed to build our reference dataset.
  
- 'environments': This folder contains the environments needed to run the model or steps in 'prepare_files'. See below the use for each task.
